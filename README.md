## Description
The aim of this project was to allow a user to dynamically create a README.md file by simply following the prompts in the terminal interface. 

Using this README generator should be much faster for the user. The generated README file can then be accessed and updated if the user elects to do so.

This project allowed me to practice capturing and storing a dynamic input. I also was able to gain familiarity with the inquirer node package. 

## Installation
No installation necessary. 

## Usage
The user will first need to open the integrated terminal. Using node, the user will then open the index.js file.

From there, the user will be prompted to answer questions in order to create their README.md file.

Once all questions have been answered, the program will create the file based on the user's responses.
