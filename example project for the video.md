## Description
I built this project to prove myself as a developer. I knew that nothing and no one could stop me.
This program solves many problems, such as world hunger, the 40-hour work week, and climate change. However, it has also created many others, such as dirty dishes and a lost sock. 
I learned to respect your elders, to chew with your mouth closed, and don't run at the pool.

## Installation
Installing is the easy part. Uninstalling is harder.

## Usage
Example 1: Imagine you are a central grader, enjoying a wonderful video, your 12th of 24 for the day. When will you stop to eat? 

## License
This project uses a Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal license. 

## Contributing
Yes, my friends Paula and Tabitha helped a lot, as did Jason Coveney. Do you remember him, from middle school? He's changed a lot. He's got a big beard now, for one.

## Tests
The best test is the trust fall, and it works. No doubt about it.
